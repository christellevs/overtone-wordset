## Quality Content for Everyone

### TECHNICAL EXERCISE

The purpose of these exercises is to assess your technical skills in combination with creative
thinking.We are constantly looking for ways to metricise human assessment of content, or
in short: we are trying to quantify quality.

That means we need to be able to work with code and step away from it too, in order to see
the context in which the text (or code, or problem) sits.

For this problem, please don’t use outside help and don’t take more than a few hours. We are
not looking for perfection: we are trying to understand how you think. For this reason, please
annotate your work so a lay-person can follow your reasoning.

### EXERCISES

1.  You are given a set of synonyms, such as (eat, consume) and (easy, simple).

    Using this set, determine if two sentences with the same number of words are equivalent.
    In this example, we define the following two sentences to be equivalent:

    - "She wants to eat food."
    - "She wants to consume food."

    Note that the synonyms (a, b) and (a, c) do not necessarily imply (b, c). Consider
    for example the case of (coach, bus) and (coach, teacher).

    Ignore cases in which a
    word has two different meanings but the same spelling, such as (lead, lead).

2.  Given the above, what if we can now assume that (a, b) and (a, c) do in fact imply
    (b, c)?
